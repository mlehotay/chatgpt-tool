Yes, you can have multiple connections open simultaneously with SQLite. Each connection operates independently and has its own transaction state, so you can perform concurrent operations on different connections. SQLite supports multiple connections to the same database file, and each connection operates in its own isolated transaction mode.

However, it's important to note that SQLite employs a file-level locking mechanism to ensure data integrity. This means that if one connection is actively performing a write operation, other connections might be blocked from performing write operations until the lock is released. Read operations can usually proceed concurrently.

In your use case, where you have the tool and the test class each having their own connection, you should be able to manage them independently. Just be mindful of any potential concurrency issues that might arise due to SQLite's locking mechanism, especially if you're performing write operations in one connection while another connection is reading or writing to the same database.
