Table: conversations_v1  
['id', 'title', 'create_time', 'update_time', 'mapping', 'moderation_results', 'current_node', 'plugin_ids']  

This structure represents a conversation with messages organized as a tree structure, where each node in the tree corresponds to a message. The `"current_node"` field indicates the current position in the conversation tree.

1. Top-Level Fields:
   - `"title"`: The title of the conversation.
   - `"create_time"`: A timestamp indicating when the conversation was created.
   - `"update_time"`: A timestamp indicating when the conversation was last updated.
   - `"mapping"`: A dictionary that maps node IDs to node objects, forming the conversation tree.
   - `"moderation_results"`: An empty list, likely used to store moderation-related information.
   - `"current_node"`: A string representing the current node in the conversation tree.
   - `"plugin_ids"`: A null value (not used in the provided data).
   - `"id"`: A unique identifier for the conversation.

2. Fields Nested Within `"mapping"`:
   - The `"mapping"` dictionary contains node IDs as keys and node objects as values. Each node object has the following fields:
     - `"id"`: A unique identifier for the node.
     - `"message"`: A dictionary representing a message within the conversation. This field may be present or absent.
     - `"parent"`: A string representing the ID of the parent node. It may be `null` if there is no parent node.
     - `"children"`: A list of strings representing the IDs of child nodes.

3. Fields Nested Within `"message"` (if present):
   - If the `"message"` field is present in a node object, it contains information about a message within the conversation. This message object has several fields:
     - `"id"`: A unique identifier for the message.
     - `"author"`: A dictionary representing the author of the message, which includes the author's role and other metadata.
     - `"create_time"`: A timestamp indicating when the message was created.
     - `"update_time"`: A timestamp indicating when the message was last updated.
     - `"content"`: A dictionary representing the content of the message, including the content type and message parts.
     - `"end_turn"`: A boolean value indicating whether the message marks the end of a turn.
     - `"weight"`: A float value representing the weight of the message.
     - `"metadata"`: A dictionary containing additional metadata related to the message.
     - `"recipient"`: A string indicating the message recipient.

4. Fields Nested Within `"content"` (if present):
   - If the `"content"` field is present in a message, it contains information about the content of the message. This content object has the following fields:
     - `"content_type"`: A string indicating the type of content (e.g., "text").
     - `"parts"`: A list of strings representing the content of the message, typically text.

Table: conversations_v2  
['id', 'title', 'create_time', 'update_time', 'mapping', 'moderation_results', 'current_node', 'plugin_ids', 'conversation_id', 'conversation_template_id']  

This structure represents a conversation with messages organized as a tree structure, similar to the previous version of JSON data you provided. The main difference between the two versions is the content of the messages, the additional fields such as `"status"`, and the associated timestamps. The structure for tracking messages and the conversation tree remains largely the same.

1. Top-Level Fields:
   - `"title"`: The title of the conversation.
   - `"create_time"`: A timestamp indicating when the conversation was created.
   - `"update_time"`: A timestamp indicating when the conversation was last updated.
   - `"mapping"`: A dictionary that maps node IDs to node objects, forming the conversation tree.
   - `"moderation_results"`: An empty list, likely used to store moderation-related information.
   - `"current_node"`: A string representing the current node in the conversation tree.
   - `"plugin_ids"`: A null value (not used in the provided data).
   - `"conversation_id"`: A unique identifier for the conversation.
   - `"conversation_template_id"`: A null value (not used in the provided data).
   - `"id"`: A unique identifier for the conversation.

2. Fields Nested Within `"mapping"`:
   - The `"mapping"` dictionary contains node IDs as keys and node objects as values. Each node object has the following fields:
     - `"id"`: A unique identifier for the node.
     - `"message"`: A dictionary representing a message within the conversation. This field may be present or absent.
     - `"parent"`: A string representing the ID of the parent node. It may be `null` if there is no parent node.
     - `"children"`: A list of strings representing the IDs of child nodes.
     - `"status"`: A string indicating the status of the message, e.g., "finished_successfully."

3. Fields Nested Within `"message"` (if present):
   - If the `"message"` field is present in a node object, it contains information about a message within the conversation. This message object has several fields:
     - `"id"`: A unique identifier for the message.
     - `"author"`: A dictionary representing the author of the message, which includes the author's role and other metadata.
     - `"create_time"`: A timestamp indicating when the message was created.
     - `"update_time"`: A timestamp indicating when the message was last updated.
     - `"content"`: A dictionary representing the content of the message, including the content type and message parts.
     - `"end_turn"`: A boolean value indicating whether the message marks the end of a turn.
     - `"weight"`: A float value representing the weight of the message.
     - `"metadata"`: A dictionary containing additional metadata related to the message.
     - `"recipient"`: A string indicating the message recipient.

4. Fields Nested Within `"content"` (if present):
   - If the `"content"` field is present in a message, it contains information about the content of the message. This content object has the following fields:
     - `"content_type"`: A string indicating the type of content (e.g., "text").
     - `"parts"`: A list of strings representing the content of the message, typically text.
