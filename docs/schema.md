To implement the updated design for schema/filename/version handling in your Python code, you'll need to make several changes and enhancements. Below, I'll outline the high-level steps and modifications you should consider:

1. **Schema Table and Database Structure:**
   - Ensure that the schema table with columns `hash_value`, `table_name`, and `column_names` is created in your SQLite database.
   - Update the `create_schema_table` function to create the schema table if it doesn't exist.

2. **Mapping Schema to Table Names:**
   - Modify the code that handles mapping between schema hashes and table names. This mapping should be used when querying data across tables with matching schema hashes.
   - Ensure that you use the `table_name` from the schema table when inserting data into the corresponding table.

3. **Versioning of Tables:**
   - Implement a versioning mechanism when schemas change. Create new tables with updated schema versions and update the schema table with the new `table_name`.
   - Consider adding a version number to the schema table to keep track of the latest schema version for each hash.

4. **Searching Across Tables:**
   - When querying data, query all tables with matching schema hashes (including different versions) to retrieve results.
   - Ensure that your query logic can search across multiple tables effectively.

5. **Maintaining Schema Information:**
   - Keep schema information in the schema table even if the schema is known. This will ensure that you can always look up schema-related details when querying the database.

6. **Future Scalability:**
   - Ensure that your code is flexible enough to accommodate new schema versions and filenames. This might involve adding additional logic to handle table creation and schema updates.

7. **Indices (Future Enhancement):**
   - As a future enhancement, you can implement indices to improve query performance. These indices can be based on filenames, version numbers, or other relevant criteria.

8. **Code Refactoring:**
   - Review and refactor your existing code to align with the updated design. Pay close attention to the parts of the code that interact with schemas, tables, and filenames.

9. **Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test your code to ensure that the new schema/filename/version handling works as expected. Test scenarios with different schema versions and filenames to validate the design.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Update code comments and documentation to reflect the changes in your schema handling approach. Make sure it's clear how schema/filename/version handling works.

It's important to carefully plan and implement these changes in your Python code to ensure that the updated design is effective in managing schemas, filenames, and versions in your SQLite database. Remember to maintain backward compatibility with your existing data while introducing these changes.
